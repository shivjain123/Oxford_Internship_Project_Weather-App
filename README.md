# Oxford_Internship_Project_Weather-App

It is a Weather App.
The App is made entirely using Python
The App is short, sleak and user-friendly. It only contains the indicators which are necessary and lay men can understand easily.

For getting Current and Future Weather Prediction, you have to enter the city name.
For getting Historical Weather Prediction, you have to enter the Latitude and Longitude.

In the first page you'll encounter 3 buttons.
Click on the one you want to and enter the required details in the page that opens up.
Finally, press the Predict Button and the prediction will appear.

The Libraries that I have used are:-
1. Tkinter ("pip3 install tkinter" or "pip3 install tk")
2. Requests (pip3 install requests)
3. Time (not needed to install, already present)
